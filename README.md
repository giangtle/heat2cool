Balance of plant calculations of an integrated system using the waste heat from a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) powered data center to cool its servers.

### Introduction
Data centers consume great amount of power. With great power comes great cooling need. One watts of cooling for each watts of power actually.

To skim on the electricity cost of traditional mechanical vapor compression air conditioner, many solutions have come in the pictures. In a cool climate, you can use outside air to cool the servers. In a hot and dry environment, evaporative cooling provides cool air by spraying outdoor air with water. You can also use cooling tower to chill water for some water-cooling on top of air-cooling. But in a hot and humid climate, or when water is especially precious, it may becomes important to find a cooling solution that works independent of climate condition and doesn't consume water.

SOFC-powered data center is poised for waste heat cooling with its large amount of medium to low grade thermal energy in the exhaust. **heat2cool** explores the integration of waste heat cooling and SOFC power generation in the basic level of energy &m aterial balances.


### Basic idea
The picture below explains the crux of the air loop.
The indoor air is evporatively cooled, cools the server rack, then the moisture is removed with desiccant to
repeate the cycle of evaporative cooling and drying.
The desiccant is regenerated using the high temperature exhaust gas of the solid oxide fuel cell.

The BoP calculates all streams denoted in the P&ID below, determine the operation of SOFC system
that matches the required cooling of servers with the waste heat generated by SOFC.

Design highlights:
* Recirculation of indoor air without introducing outdoor air.
* Water recaptured by flue gas condensation, potentially water generating instead of water consuming.
