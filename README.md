Balance of plant calculations of an integrated system using the waste heat from a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) powered data center to cool its servers.

### Basic idea
The picture below explains the crux of waste heat cooling.
The indoor air is evporatively cooled, cools the server rack, then the moisture is removed with desiccant to
repeate the cycle of evaporative cooling and drying.
The desiccant is regenerated using the high temperature exhaust gas of the solid oxide fuel cell.

The BoP calculates all streams denoted in the P&ID below, determine the operation of SOFC system
that matches the required cooling of servers with the waste heat generated by SOFC.
